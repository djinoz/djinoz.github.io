subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me

FIRST BITE is a non-profit project to encourage us all to increase our gratitude and enjoyment of the food we are lucky enough to receive.

We wrote the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc34wo93rlGqWYoCCx3uEecI4ZMyQ-sNfnbLa31DEGNPqyyw/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0">Book</a> initially as a reminder to ourselves and some science and exercises to experiment.

The most interesting part is the challenge of social awkwardness.

- Why is saying "Grace" so rare these days?
- Why are we afraid to simply stop? 
- What kind of society thinks gratitude is unhip?

So we thought having <a target="_blank" href="https://prismism.com/graphic-design/">place cards</a> and drink coasters is an invite that people can choose to accept.
