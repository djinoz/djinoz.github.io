title: About FIRST BITE
subtitle: Fall in love with your food

FIRST BITE is a non-profit project to encourage us all to increase our gratitude and enjoyment of the food we are lucky enough to eat. We wrote the <a target="_blank" href="https://a.co/d/hD0O5lF">Book</a> initially as a reminder to ourselves, included some exercises that we found particularly helpful and added some science to back it up.

FIRST BITE is a simple call-to-action to start each and every meal with three mindful bites, and observe the contribution to your life and others around you. Interestingly, a major challenge is social awkwardness. Anything that calls a halt to a social gathering these days can be awkward, even if it’s for just a moment.

Encouraging a small quiet moment at the beginning of a meal to say Grace, make a toast, or thank the hosts all seems quite acceptable. To simply stop and take a breath, to have a quiet moment of gratitude, to share this with friends and family can seem daunting and awkward.

As an icebreaker and a conversation prompt, we devised <a target="_blank" href="https://prismism.com/graphic-design/">place cards</a> and drink coasters as an invition that people can choose to accept.

### Our Mission


It's a bit like any Slow Movement. Word of mouth is the key.
  * If we can convert one or two people,
    * then they might convert one or two people,
      * then they might convert one or two people,
        * then they might convert one or two people…..you get the idea…

Stop and savour. Enjoy your first bite, and your second, and your third, …
